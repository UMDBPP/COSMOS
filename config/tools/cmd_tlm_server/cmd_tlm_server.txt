# CCSDS_INT is a serial interface designed to talk directly to a payload's serial connection using CCSDS messages.
# The interface will calculate the checksum and length of any packet sent through it and will overwrite 
# those fields of the CCSDS header.

# LINKCCSDS_INT is designed to talk to payloads through the LINK message routing.
# This iterface performs the same actions as the CCSDS_INT for the outgoing packets. 
#
# The interface will also automatically wrap any non-LINK message sent through it (as identified by the APIDs
# of the message not being in the range assigned to LINK in APIDs.txt) with a LINK XB_FSWMSG command header
# and a destination xbee address (as defined in APIDs.txt) so that LINK will forward the message to the 
# proper payload.

#
# The interface will also wrap any non-XBee message sent through it (as identified by the lack of start bytes)
# with a Xbee header which will result in the message being sent to the proper address (as defined in APIDs.txt).

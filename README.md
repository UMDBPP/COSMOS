# COSMOS

The COSMOS ground system is an open-source spacecraft ground system created by Ball Aerospace. This repo contains
the configuration for a ground station to send commands to and interpret telemetry from UMD BPP payloads.

Once COSMOS has been installed (see instructions here: https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos/wiki/How-to-install-Cosmos) 
run 'Launcher.bat' to start the ground system.
